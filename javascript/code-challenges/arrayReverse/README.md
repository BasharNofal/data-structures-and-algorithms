Reversing arrays without using methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

I used normal for loop which loops through the elements of an array from last to first then push each element into a new array. 

For me that was the first idea that came to my mind and it's very simple and easy to understand, also it's only a for loop with a line of code to push the elements into a new array, so it's not long.
